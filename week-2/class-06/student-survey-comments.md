## Selections from Weekly Survey Results

### WHICH ASPECTS OF THE TRAINING DID YOU FIND THE MOST HELPFUL DURING THIS WEEK?

The general structure of lab coupled with lecture and demos has been a great learning process. Being able to experiment and try things out and then see the different ways the same result could be achieved is very interesting. The assistance from the TAs and Instructors is the right mix of prompting and helping. They really want us to find the solutions for ourselves.

The instructors and TAs have been doing a great job in ensuring that we the students are able to develop the skills and knowledge required to build a strong base. Examples being git workflows and best practices, debugging tools, JS loops and functions.

Examining our code on the projector and talking about how to write and format it more effectively.

The partner coding challenge was helpful

The pair programming portion was very helpful. I was resistant to it but enjoyed it thoroughly.

### WHICH ASPECTS OF THE TRAINING DID YOU FIND THE LEAST HELPFUL DURING THIS WEEK?

If anything, I would say the readings. I learn the most from doing hands on coding.

I'd rate the book as alright. It's certainly useful and necessary to the course, but it's not the most innovative book in the world.

Canvas. still buggy as hell.

I feel we might be spending a bit too much time going over assignments during class time

Sometimes the book review segments in the afternoon feel disjointed and the webcam is not focused on the screen well enough to capture what is on the screen. Having the ability to refer to material covered in class is huge. Especially when this segment is fast paced and covers a lot of material.

Usually the afternoon portions. There are insightful moments, but there are lulls where there's less to take away in a given moment.

That's hard, it was all helpful. More examples during lecture would be great


### DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, SUGGESTIONS, OR CONCERNS?

I think there should be a better integrated process for moving on to the next course, in this case 301. Scholarships and early application are do a week after 201 starts. An automatic invite to 301 once you begin the 201 course seems like a good idea.

Some of the course materials could use a little bit of tightening up. I feel that there were a number of instances where the materials could have been a little more straightforward in how they were explained.

In many of the course assignments, we've been told to reference specific information from the course site or things we've been sent in Slack. Since these are often spread all over the place and time sensitive, it's usually very hard to find them again; I wish that the links or materials would be aggregated somewhere or linked in the assignment prompts. I've spent a substantial amount of time trying to find this reference material when that time would be better spent coding.

No questions but a concern. The prework for this course is a good portion of your grade and if you sign up late to the course you will not be able to get it all done in time. You will struggle to finish it in the first week (the js takes a long time to complete) or lose credit and part of your grade for missing it. This should be handled differently, maybe it could be a part of 101 content? This is valuable information for 201 but it's a lot to expect last minute sign ups to tackle while in class.
