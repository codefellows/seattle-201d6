## Class 11 (Week 3, Monday)

1. Announcements and Survey Comments
  - Our incredible shrinking class... let's talk about it a little.
  - Thanks again for being agreeable about Presidents' Day last week. Apologies that we did not plan better.
  - Any feedback on the guest speaker last Thursday, beyond the little bit that appeared in survey comments?
  - Reminder: We're getting closer to Project Week. Prep your pitches! Look at prior projects!
  - Surveys are important! They are read and discussed all the way up to the CEO. We value your feedback. Feedback is a gift.
2. Merge Conflicts with Duncan!
3. Domain Modeling (kind of like TDD?): today you're writing your own user stories.
4. Review of Week 2 Projects
  - What went great?
  - What would you have done differently?
  - Look at a few samples?
  - Now's a great time for any Q&A you might have!
