### WHICH ASPECTS OF THE TRAINING DID YOU FIND THE MOST HELPFUL DURING THIS WEEK?

I'm getting better on relying on my console for troubleshooting. It's been great to help understand what's happening behind the scenes.

I found the break down of the different functions helpful.

I found the code review to be the most helpful this week. It was a stressful week and I really got the most help learning how to do the code and then being able to go back and implement it in my code the following night.

The assistance and support from the other classmates this week was AMAZING! Many thanks to everyone from anonymous!

Working on the same project throughout the week was great. It helped things come together as different elements were implemented. The day (weds I think?) when we went over our projects, instead of doing a code review. Having the demo, Q/A and walk-through was so incredibly useful. Having the ability to ask specific questions during the demo, and being able to see it worked through, really helped me to progress in a way I wouldn't have been able to otherwise. Also, being able to refer to the code after the lecture also really helps, being able to take it apart and inspect it really helped me to understand the way the elements were working together and allowed me to adapt how I was writing my code.

### WHICH ASPECTS OF THE TRAINING DID YOU FIND THE LEAST HELPFUL DURING THIS WEEK?

Still the reading. The book gives you a starting point, but I often google for more in depth information on a subject.

Having the guy come in and explain functions.

As always, the book.

Being stuck... I felt like the time spent being stuck this week only continued to cause further frustration, resulting in some type of 'while' loop. In many instances, when asking for clarification, I felt like I was left in further confusion by the time a TA / instructor moved on... frustratedStudent = true; while (frusteratedStudent === true) { if (confused) { alert('Please help me TAs and Instructors!'); frustratedStudent = true; } }

It was hard for me in general, to feel that I had the time to get to content of each day that was out of the scope of the labs.


### DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, SUGGESTIONS, OR CONCERNS?

Our class has lecture in the afternoon and lab in the morning. I think lecture in the morning and lab in the afternoon would be the better schedule as students can start their lab work with assistance and then finish the work after hours if they need more time. If students want to get a jump start on projects they often head down the wrong road. So they're left with the choice of only working in lab and unlikely finishing their projects by the due date, or trying to work ahead and often going in the wrong direction. I think this is why several students end up working through lunch.

Things did not click for myself until spending many hours this weekend reviewing all of this weeks topics, but I feel much better now. I'm don't think I am the only one in this boat and wonder if this is true. Fist of five to see where everyone feels they are at overall? I feel it would be a better learning experience to begin the day with lecture and ending with the labs. I wonder if this has already been attempted in the past and/or if this might be an option for us. Thoughts?

It would really help things gel if you were able to focus on one project each week and use it as a way to teach multiple concepts. I think this really helps to join things together and see how things progress you learn new concepts. Something else I personally would find helpful, is a few resources per each class to elaborate on concepts we discuss. Sometimes a concept will make much more sense if you see it in a few different presentations.
